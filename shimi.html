									Shimi is a small companion robot that was created by the Georgia Tech Robotic Musicianship Lab as a dancing musical assistant. After a few years of the project being dormant, Shimi has been reimagined as an assistant for the deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) community.
									<br/>The aim is for Shimi to develop and study tools that will help members of the DHH community enjoy music. This includes dancing to music, music playback, haptic feedback, lyric display, and graphic visuals.

										<h3>Project Management</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										When the project restarted, I advised 4 undergraduate students on their project work. This involved developing project timelines, leading weekly meetings, and assisting with project work. My students focused on various aspects of the project including testing hardware, developing dances for Shimi, creating connections to the Spotify API, and researching computer vision. Guiding a wide variety of projects meant I needed to stay in communication with my students and become comfortable with all aspects of the project. 
										<br> 
										I used Notion for project planning and weekly updates, and we strove to follow agile methodologies.

										<h3>Communication Protocol and API</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										I expanded on my student's work and developed a communication protocol for Shimi. Shimi runs on an NVIDIA Jetson, and during development, we used an external monitor to interface with the Jetson directly or indirectly with VIM. This was practical for development, but too cumbersome for clean demos. I created a client-server system to interface with Shimi more smoothly. 
										<br>
										An undergraduate student created a phone app to control Shimi. With my client-server system, I worked with him to connect his application to Shimi. This boiled down to creating a Shimi API to control dancing, music playback, and haptic feedback.
